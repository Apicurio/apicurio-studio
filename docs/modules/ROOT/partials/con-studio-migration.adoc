= Migration from version {studio-legacy-version} to version {studio-version}

[role="_abstract"]
{studio-long} {studio-version} includes new features with breaking changes from the previous {studio} {studio-legacy-version} release. This section describes the major changes between {studio} {studio-legacy-version} and version {studio-version}.

Because of the breaking changes in 1.x, there is no automatic upgrade and a migration process is required. This involves moving the data in your existing {studio} to a new {studio} instance.

When migrating to version 1.x, you must take the following major changes into account:

== Unsupported features

*__TODO:__* https://www.apicur.io/blog/2024/03/22/studio-1.0

== New deployment structure

*__TODO__*

== Data storage options

*__TODO__*

== New v1 REST API

*__TODO__*

= Restoring {studio} PostgreSQL storage

You can restore SQL Dump files created by `pg_dump` using the `psql` utility.

.Prerequisites
* You must have already backed up your PostgreSQL database using `pg_dump`. See xref:studio-sql-backup[].
* All users who own objects or have permissions on objects in the dumped database must already exist.

.Procedure
. Enter the following command to create the database:
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ createdb -T template0 dbname
----

. Enter the following command to restore the SQL dump
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ psql dbname < dumpfile
----

. Run https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-analyze.html[ANALYZE] on each database so the query optimizer has useful statistics.

|Storage option
|Description

ifndef::apicurio-studio-downstream[]
|In-memory
|Data is stored in RAM on each {studio} node. This is the easiest deployment to use, but is not recommended for production environment. All data is lost when restarting {studio} with this storage option, which is suitable for a development environment only.
endif::[]

|SQL database  
|Data is stored in a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL 12+. This is the recommended storage option in a production environment for performance, stability, and data management (backup/restore, and so on).

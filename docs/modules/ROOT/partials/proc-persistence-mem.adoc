= Configuring {studio} In-Memory storage using CLI

The in-memory storage option uses RAM to store the data on nodes where {studio} is deployed, and it is the simplest persistence option to use.

.Prerequisites
* You must have a {container-platform} cluster with cluster administrator access.

.Procedure
. *__TODO__*

IMPORTANT: This persistence option does not support data distribution across {studio} nodes.
Therefore, it is only recommended for development environments using a single replica (`Pod`).
